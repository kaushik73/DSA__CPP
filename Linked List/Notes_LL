struct node *next; // it is a pointer points to a data type of struct node.

node * newnode = new node(); -> creates a new node.

REVERSE OF A SINGLY LL :
    struct node *current = head;
    struct node *next = NULL;
    struct node *prev = NULL;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        next = current->next; //next ↑
        current->next = prev; //Main ↑
        prev = current;       //prev ↑
        current = next;       //current ↑
    }
    head = prev;
